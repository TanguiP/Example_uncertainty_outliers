# Example_uncertainty_outliers
The code included in this repository includes a fully working example of the calculations made in the paper Picart et al. in revision in the International Journal of Climatology.
The example includes the Python code needed to calculate individual difference metrics, a novel estimation of the uncertainty and the resulting outliers. It makes use of all eight high-resolution gridded precipitation products: CMORPH, ERA5, GSMaP, IMERG, MSWEP, PERSIANN, STAGE IV and TMPA over a limited region.
